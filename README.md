## Hi, I'm Trieu ðŸ‘‹
	
I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University. I am particularly interested in machine learning, neural networks, building computer vision systems, and applying machine learning in production.
	
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m cracking the data science and machine learning engineering interviews.
ðŸ’¼ I am searching for opportunities as a Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, and Software Engineer.
